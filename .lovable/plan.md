# ✨ LUMIÈRE FINE JEWELRY — Brand & Store Plan

## Brand Concept

**Brand Name: Lumière** (French for "light") — A sophisticated, minimalist jewelry brand specializing in fine bridal and everyday luxury pieces. The name evokes brilliance, elegance, and timeless beauty without sounding like a typical dropshipping store.

**Positioning:** Affordable luxury ($59-79) with a direct-to-consumer story focused on craftsmanship and ethical sourcing.

**Tagline:** "Brilliance, redefined."

## Product Strategy

### Hero Product: The "Eternal Radiance" Ring
- **Price Point:** $67 (psychological pricing)
- **Materials Messaging:** "Sterling Silver with AAA Cubic Zirconia" — position as an ethical, conflict-free alternative to mined diamonds
- **Variants:** Multiple sizes (5-10)
- **Story:** Handcrafted for the modern bride who values elegance without compromise

### AI-Generated Imagery
I'll create custom product images using AI image generation to:
- Show the ring on elegant hands with soft lighting
- Create lifestyle shots (bridal, romantic, everyday wear)
- Design hero banners and social-proof visuals
- Avoid any reverse image search matches
